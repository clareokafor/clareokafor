# 👋 Hi there, I’m Ogochukwu Jane Okafor  

> “Numbers tell stories — I turn them into insights.”  

I’m a **Data Scientist & Machine Learning Engineer** who thrives at the intersection of **data, AI, and real-world impact**. My journey started in economics classrooms in Nigeria, moved through building BI dashboards in Lagos, and has now grown into **training large language models, designing synthetic datasets, and pushing the frontiers of Generative AI**.  

Today, I wear many hats:  
- 🎓 **Lecturer** inspiring students in economics & statistics  
- 🧪 **AI Trainer** designing experiments for LLMs  
- 📊 **Data Scientist** building analytics that sharpen decision-making  
- 🌍 **Volunteer & Mentor** paying it forward through STEM initiatives

## 🚀 What I Do Best  
- 🧩 Build **LLM evaluation pipelines** that make AI smarter & more reliable  
- 📈 Design **data visualizations & dashboards** that tell business-changing stories  
- 🔬 Experiment with **synthetic datasets** to simulate complex real-world problems  
- ⚡ Connect **economics + machine learning** to bring fresh insights into AI solutions
